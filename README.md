# BreachBot-gwc-project-

### This is a Beginner Python Project
This project shows examples of:
- Varying responses based on user input.
- a conditional to identify the details of a data breach and the organization's response.
- a while loop to repeat breach research.
- a conditional to display three reflections: a reaction, its connection to the CIA Triad, and an advice.
- a while loop to repeat reflections.
- a break statement to end the while-loops.
